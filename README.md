- Project coordinator: Popa Iulian
- Points:
    - Base requirements: max. 8 pts
    - Advanced requirements: max. 2 pts
    - Custom element: max. 1 pt
- Demo Video explaining code segments + showcasing app functionality required (deadline: 14th of January)
- Allowed libraries / frameworks
    - [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/)
    - [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
    - [Qt](https://qt.io)

    - [fnc12/sqlite_orm](https://github.com/fnc12/sqlite_orm)
    - others, if the project coordinator allows using them

# Base requirements (max. 8 pts)
- ðŸ•¥ Networking: respect client-server architecture (at least 2 client instances + 1 server)
- ðŸ•¥ Login / Register page
- ðŸ•¥ Game Page: console app that substitutes drawing the word with describing it while not using words in the lexical family of said word
- ðŸ•¥ Use at least 500 words, each match will have unique and random words
- ðŸ•¥ Database: must use SQLite through [fnc12/sqlite_orm](https://github.com/fnc12/sqlite_orm)

# Advanced components (max. 2 pts)
- ðŸ•¥ Meeting room: player uses a code to join other players
- ðŸ•¥ Profile page: the profile page contains a game history (scores for each game and average of said scores)
- ðŸ•¥ GUI: drawing version of the game using Qt

# Custom element ideas (max. 1 pt)
- ðŸ•¥ Difficulty setting: Easy/Medium/Hard; this should affect the number of hints and the dynamics of the game
- ðŸ•¥ Buying clues using points obtained during the game, the cost of each being stored in the database with the cost being related to each word
- ðŸ•¥ Handling more than 2 games at once on the server
- ðŸ•¥ Handling exceptions and implementing unit tests (coverage 50%)
